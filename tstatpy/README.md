# Thermostat

This is a basic python implementation of the logic for a thermostat

### Usage:

```bash
python thermostat.py
```

This should start a prompt. Press `enter`, and that should open a plotting window allowing you to see the thermostat simulation trace.

Press `enter` to advance a timestep.

You can press buttons by typing them into the prompt and hitting `enter`:
- `inc sp` (increase both setpoints)
- `dec sp` (decrease both setpoints)
- `on`: toggle power (this may not work right)
